<h1>CTiS: Digital inclusion, and what steps are to be taken to provide internet access globally</h1>
<h2>Sililo, Daniel, Caleb, Mike</h2>

</ul><p>Currently over 66% of the population have some form of access to the internet (proper reference) </p>
<p>The site is not particularly well presented, but as the site uses HTML and has been styled with CSS it can be regarded as a <em>"minimum viable product"</em> for the purposes of this project&hellip;
It has some default links, which you can take as a start for your site structure.  The <em>Process Support </em>Links provides guidance which will be needed for presenting your final project. </p>
